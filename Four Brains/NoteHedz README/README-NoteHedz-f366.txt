First public release version 1.01, February 5, 2005.
Experimental versions 1.1 - 1.6 exhibited in late August - early September 2005.
If you have any of versions 1.1 - 1.6, discard them.
Version 1.7 released September 12, 2005

Version 1.7 contains additional characters that were not in the version 1.0.1 font.
No change has been made to any of the original characters.

This font was designed for Windows. It has also been tested using Knoppix Linux 3.6.
It may work (but has not been tested) on Mac OS-X.

The font has characters in all of the code locations 0020 - 007E (decimal 32 - 126) accessible
by ordinary keyboard, and in the non-ASCII range 00A1 - 00FF (decimal 161 - 255).
The additional characters (version 1.70) are in code locations 128-159 (decimal),
and are of interest to users of a particular program running on the Windows platform.
Other platforms may or may not be able to access the additional chanracters.

Symbols intended for shaped-note users are self explanatory.
If you don't know what shaped notes are, then most of the symbols are just geometric shapes.

Keystrokes a - g produce fully-formed, ordinary notes (stem up) with letters A- G enclosed in the notehead.
Keystrokes h - n  produce the same notes, but with stems down.
The uppercase characters A - G and H - N are the same, but with a flag added to the note stem.

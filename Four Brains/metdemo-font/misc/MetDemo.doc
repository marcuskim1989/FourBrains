Our hope is that this plain vanilla text file can be read by anyone. We suggest that you change the entire document to a comfortable text font in your word processor and go through it, changing the examples (where it says SELECT THE NEXT LINE. . .) to MetDemo before you print out the Guide.**************************************************>> Terms and Disclaimers:MetDemo is a fully functional demonstration font with some 25% of the characters from the music fonts Metronome and MetTimes (both copyright 1989-1998 by DVM Publications). MetDemo may be freely downloaded from online services and given to anyone interested in it without charge. MetDemo may not be sold for profit by anyone, and DVM Publications retains all rights to the font. We do ask that this User's Guide be included without alterations with the font. Although there is no reason to think that MetDemo should not work on any Macintosh, or on any PC running Windows 3.1 or higher, DVM Publications is not responsible for any problems users might experience (hardware, software, or psychological) by using the program. **************************************************>>  New to this versionMetDemo v. 2.0 has several improved characters and two new characters added. The improved characters are the staff line/half-staff line/barline/final barline characters. In addition, weÕve replaced the vanilla ÒTimesÓ numbers with a group of proportionally-spaced Òold-styleÓ numbers. WeÕve replaced the whole note with a half note to make the font more useful for creating metronome markings. The new characters are the stacked 1-2, which replaces the lower case "q," and the treble clef on the shift-; key.>>  What is MetDemo and who caresMetDemo is a truetype subset of the commercial music fonts Metronome v. 3.5 and MetTimes v. 2.6.  Unlike the "standard" music fonts, Adobe's Sonata and Coda's Petrucci (among others), MetDemo and its commercial brethren are designed to work like text fonts; doing many of the useful little chores that musicians need to do but cannot do easily in most music notation programs. MetDemo works in all music notation programs, all word processors, all page layout programs, all graphic programs--in short, it works anywhere a normal font will work.With MetDemo you can type:	>>	Metronome markings	>>	Proportions	>>	Chord symbols	>>	Figured bass symbols	>>	Instant staff paper	>>	Pedal markings	>>	Rhythm examples in a word processor	>>	Text and dynamics without changing fonts	>>	Boxed rehearsal letters and numbers	>>	Stacked numbers for instrumental namesSince MetDemo only has 25% of the characters of Metronome and MetTimes, it doesn't do any of these things as well as its big brothers. It should, however, prove useful for some things, and obviously we hope that you will like it so much that you'll spring for the commercial versions to get the extra capabilities they offer.**************************************************>>	Installing MetDemoMetDemo installs like any other font on a Mac or PC:With all applications closed, Mac System 7 users should drag the file "MetDemo.Ttype" onto the System folder on the hard drive. When the Mac asks if you want the files put in the Fonts folder (Sys. 7.1-5) or "Special Places" (Sys. 7.0x), just say "yes."Mac System 6.x users should open the Font/DA mover and copy the MetDemo.Ttype files into the system--make sure you have Apple's "Truetype" init loaded (required for System 6 users).PC-Windows (v. 3.1 or later required) users should do the following:	Open the Windows control panel	Open the Fonts panel	Click on the Add button	Use the Drives and Directories lists to locate METDEMO_.TTF	Select METDEMO_.TTF (in the "List of Fonts" window) and click OK.Note:  MetDemo includes 94 characters, located on the standard and shifted keyboards. Metronome and MetTimes each have twice that number of characters and use all of the slots on the option and shift-option keyboards (Mac version) or Alt-0 characters (Windows version).**************************************************USING METDEMO>>	Metronome MarkingsThe font, Metronome, got its name originally because, back in the days when MOTU's Professional Composer was the only game in town for music notation, there was literally no way to put Metronome markings in scores. And strangely enough, the method we came up with is _still_ the easiest way to enter metronome markings in any music notation program. It could hardly be easier:Using any tool that supports text entry (staff and score expression or Header tools in Coda's Finale--similar tools in other programs), and with MetDemo selected as the current font (we usually use 14 pt. size), type:<Shift-q> <=> <any number combination>MetDemo also includes an eighth note on the shift-e character. [Metronome includes all notes from 1/64th to breve, plus four different number sets.](SELECT THE NEXT LINE and change the font to 14 pt. MetDemo to see how the metronome markings appear)(Q=120)                (W=``c.60)              very slowly -- E = 48**************************************************>>	ProportionsOccasionally, when going from section to section in a piece of music you will want to tell the performer that the eighth note of the new section is equal to the quarter in the old section. Again, using any tool that supports text entry all you need do is type the symbols in.[Metronome includes a full set of tuplets, including triplets, for creating swing markings like "two eighths = triplet quarter eighth." It also has partial brackets for creating metric modulations.]**************************************************>>	Chord SymbolsMetDemo includes both baseline and superscripted accidentals which you can mix with text. This demo version includes all of the lower case letters except z, x and v (which are replaced by the capital A and B, and the stacked 1-2). [MetTimes includes a full upper and lower case character set, plus all accidentals from the double-flat to the double-sharp in baseline and superscript versions. MetTimes is a full family which includes the entire character set in Plain, Italic, Bold and Bold-Italic versions]The accidentals are properly spaced and kerned* for use in any program. Type <x><shift-h><space><major> to create the words Bb major (with a real flat sign). Or use the superscripted numbers to create more complex chords:  <z><shift-k><m><shift-m> for an A#m7 chord. The characters from shift-z to shift-/ are all superscripted numbers (except for shift-b, which would be the less-than-useful 5; in this demo version it is a subscripted 4). Note that the superscripted numbers all have a character width of zero (this allows us to drop subscripted numbers directly below them). If you want to use two numbers in a row (for a "B13 chord," for example) you should type the ` key, which creates a 1/2 space in MetDemo.(SELECT THE NEXT LINE and change the font to 14 pt. MetDemo to see how you can mix text and accidentals--note that it may look cramped onscreen, but it will print out correctly)zH major              zJ is correct.       xob's xL xranle      zKsusZ``Z---------*"Kerning" is a changed spacing between specific letters. The classic case are the letters T and o. The lower case o should tuck under the crossbar of the upper case T for a professional look. The superscripted accidentals in MetDemo (and, of course, MetTimes) are kerned towards the upper case A. Not all programs can utilize kerning information, but Finale, as well as all page layout programs, should.---------**************************************************>>	Figured BassMetronome has a set of super and subscripted numbers, plus the upper and lower case i and v. We thought the superscripts would be more useful for users of MetDemo (since the number of character slots was quite limited) but you can get the general idea by typing the following: <i><shift-n><shift-b>.(SELECT THE NEXT LINE and change the font to 14 pt. MetDemo to see how the figured bass characters appear)iN          vNB          ii~M[Please note that Metronome can only do two-deep numbers; baroque specialists who require a dedicated font should check either CodaÕs web site for links to some makers of figured bass fonts.]**************************************************>>	Instant staff paperHere's a quick feature you can use in any word processor (you obviously wouldn't need this in a notation program). Type <shift-4><shift-5><shift-5><shift-5> etc. in 28 pt. MetDemo. You have instant staff paper. You can add barlines and repeat signs using the shift-8, shift-\, and \ characters. Type <shift-4><shift-5><shift-5><shift-5><shift-\><shift-5><shift-5><shift-5><\> to get a line with 2 measures. The bass clef (shift-4) is another character with zero width (so it can be placed IN the staff)--if you want to use the clef in a sentence you should follow it with two or three spaces.You can also include Time Signatures: type <shift-4><shift-5><shift-6><shift-6><shift-7><shift-5><shift-5> etc. The shift-6 character is a staff extender for small adjustments.(SELECT THE NEXT 2 LINES and change the font to 24-32 pt. MetDemo to see how "instant staff paper" appears)$%%%%%|%%%%|%%%%\$%^^&%%%%|%%%%|%%%%*[Metronome includes treble, bass, tenor and alto clefs, as well as a full set of numbers to create any standard time signature.]**************************************************>>	Pedal MarkingsWe engrave a lot of piano music, and we needed a faster way to put in graphic pedal markings. The method below works well in Coda's Finale, but will probably not work as described in any other notation program.In Finale, using the Lyrics tool with 10-point MetDemo as the font (the point size is critical to this) you can enter the shift-1, 2, 3 pedal characters under the correct notes and then use Word-Extensions to connect them. There are a couple of elegant things about this technique: using the Lyrics tool all of the markings will be vertically identical, and all of the pedal markings, along with the extensions, can be moved up or down simultaneously on a line by line basis; these characters are correctly placed horizontally, with the start and stop pedals beginning in the notes and the partial-release pedal appearing just after the note. In addition, you can now copy-paste sections pedal markings without worrying about losing vertical integrity from marking to marking.One minor caveat--on our laserwriter IIf with Fineprint enabled, we found that the "join" between the word extension and the pedal markings was off by one dot at certain reductions. (One was the 85% size we normally use for piano music; the join was perfect at 84% size.) We believe this is a result of Fineprint's interpolation scheme and will not occur in linotronic printout, but we haven't tried it yet, so be forewarned.There is also a pedal extension on the shift-hyphen key. (SELECT THE NEXT LINE and change the font to 14 pt. MetDemo to see what the pedal markings look like--REMEMBER you should use 10 pt. size in Finale, though, to get a nice join with the word extensions)!_____@`______@`_____#[These characters are identical to the pedals in Metronome v. 3.5. A macro program that allows you to put each character with a regular space on one keystroke (we're using control-1, 2 and 3) can make entering these markings very fast in Finale]**************************************************>>	Rhythm examplesMetDemo characters can be combined to create fairly complex rhythms in your word processor. Try typing the following: <shift-q><shift-r>. You will get two beamed eighth notes. For these types of combinations, you will always type the quarter note symbol first and let the other characters beam to it. Below are some examples. You can see that the 1/2 space (`) and the beam extender (shift-u) can be used to improve the spacing in some figures.(SELECT THE NEXT LINE and change the font to 14-24 pt. MetDemo)&    Q    QTTT  QU.Y  QU`RT  |   E Q    S  QTR  Q    |   W      \[Metronome includes a complete set of notes, from thirty-second to breve, and beaming figures, along with a complete set of tuplets, to notate any figure short of one with nested tuplets]**************************************************>>	Mixing dynamics and textWe frequently found ourselves creating expressions that mixed dynamics with text (Òcresc. to ffÓ), and found it time-consuming to do in music notation programs. Even worse was the problem of courtesy and editorial dynamics, with parens or brackets around the dynamics. MetTimes solves all of those problems with a complete set of dynamics which are spaced to allow any combination you can type including r, s, and z characters (to create sffffz, or rfz or just ffpp). You can see the principle with the few characters we could fit into MetDemo.(SELECT THE NEXT LINE and change the font to 14 pt. MetDemo)(`F`)              subito `DO              decresc. to` PPPPPThe reason the dynamics look like the dynamics in Coda's Petrucci font is because we initially designed just a couple of them to use in MetTimes to make it easier to put in courtesy dynamics. Since we still intended to use Petrucci dynamics throughout the rest of the project we did our best to match those characters (you will find that 14 pt. MetDemo dynamics are a very close match for 24 pt. Petrucci dynamics). A different project a few weeks later required the use of rinforzato and forzato figures (when you engrave for publishers and they demand a forzato and NOT a sforzando, then you wind up creating characters to keep your business), and by the time we were done we had a larger set of dynamics in our font than either Petrucci or Sonata. Now we just use MetTimes exclusively.**************************************************>>	Boxed rehearsal letters and numbersA bug in earlier (pre 3.01) versions of Coda's Finale brought about this feature, and we still find it an easy way to create rehearsal letters. It should work in any notation program.Type <[><any letter><]>  You should get a boxed letter. (We usually use 18 pt. size for this one.)For extra-wide words or multiple numbers you can use the forward <shift-[> and backward <shift-]> box extenders, with the 1/2 space, if necessary.(SELECT THE NEXT LINE and change the font to 18 pt. MetDemo)[z]       [{13}2}]      [x}H}`}s}e}c}t}i}o}n}]**************************************************>>	Stacked numbers for instrumentationIt is difficult, when creating band or orchestral scores, to indicate that two parts share a line. Most notation programs will only allow one line of text to describe each instrument ("Bassoon"), so most computer-generated scores wind up with: "Bassoon 1/2." Publishers generally won't accept this, so we created three stacked numbers for MetTimes: 1-2, 2-3, 3-4. We include the stacked 1-2 in MetDemo.(SELECT THE NEXT LINE and change the font to 18 pt. MetDemo)xassoon q**************************************************>>	AddendaBelow is the character set for MetDemo. You should format this manual so that there is a page break just before the words "standard keyboard." Then, using a nice text font (New Century Schoolbook or Palatino, for example) select all of the characters and set them to 18 pt. size with a little extra leading (try 24 point leading). Then, select the second line of each pair and change it MetDemo. Put in spaces as necessary to make everything line up and you will be able to quickly see what character lies on which key.STANDARD KEYBOARD`  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0  -  =  \`  1   2   3  4   5   6   7  8   9   0  -  =    \  q  w  e  r  t  y  u  i  o  p  [     ]    q  w   e   r  t  y   u  i  o   p   [      ]      a  s  d  f  g  h  j  k  l   ;  '      a   s   d  f  g   h  j   k   l  ;  '       z  x  c  v  b  n  m  ,  .  /       z   x  c   v  b  n   m  ,   .  /  SHIFT KEYBOARD~   !      @   #    $   %  ^  &   *   (  )  _  +  | ~  !  @    #   $      %    ^    &       *    (   )  _    +    |   Q  W  E  R  T  Y  U  I  O    P  {     }  Q    W   E   R   T   Y  U     I  O     P   {         }    A  S  D  F  G  H  J  K  L  :  "     A   S  D    F   G    H    J    K    L  :  "        Z  X  C  V  B  N  M  <  >  ?      Z     X     C      V      B      N      M      <    >      ?Order Form for the Metronome v. 3.5/MetTimes v. 2.6 package*:Name: _____________________________Company: ___________________________Address: ____________________________City/State/Zip: ________________________Phone: ______________________________Platform (circle one):     Macintosh          PC/WindowsSingle user copies are $24.95 each + $3.00 S/H per order.Site Licenses are $97.00 each + $3.00 S/H.Overseas orders, please add $5.05 S/H (for a total of $30.00 for a single user copy)DVM Publications is not a credit card vendor (sorry, but this is an engraving shop, primarily).
